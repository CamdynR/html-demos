  <h1>HTML Base Element Demo</h1>
  
  <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Example 1</h2>
  <p style="font-size:16pt;">&lt;base href="https://mywebsite.com/"&gt;</p>
  <p>In this example, since the href attribute is set, any link on this document will open with <a href="#">https://mywebsite.com/</a> as the base of that URL.
  <br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> Notice how there is no closing tag. This element does not take any content (outside of its attributes) so a closing tag is excluded.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Example 2</h2>
  <p style="font-size:16pt;">&lt;base target="_blank"&gt;</p>
  <p>This example shows that the base element doesn't necessarily require the href attribute, you can use just
    the target attribute if you so choose. 
    <br>
    This example will open any link in the document in a new tab.
    <br>
    <b>NOTE:</b> The base element requires AT LEAST one of these two attributes, target or href. You must use
    at least one.
  </p>

  
  <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Example 3</h2>
  <p style="font-size:16pt;">&lt;base href="https://mywebsite.com/" target="_blank"&gt;</p>
  <p>And naturally, you can use both attributes together if you so choose. 
    <br>
    This will have the combined effect of setting <a href="#">https://mywebsite.com/</a> as the base URL for any link or document in this document, as well as opening that URL in a new browser tab.
